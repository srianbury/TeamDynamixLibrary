class to help query Team Dynamix

I have been writing a web appilcation that talks with Team Dynamix through their API.  I built this class to handle those queries.  If you 
need to write a web app that talks with TD this class should help get you started.  If you build off this code please make a commit!  There are many more queries that Team Dynamix can handle which I did not need.
